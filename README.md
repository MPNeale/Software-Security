# Software-Security

-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    
    Artemis financial is a financial company. Their main concern was to encrypt their long term storage archive.   
    
-What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    
    I learned about different encryption algorithms and which are best depending on the situation. secure coding and software security are of the highest value for a company's overall wellbeing.
    
-What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

    Getting the program to run was the biggest challenge and I did not really find anything helpful.

-How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
 
    referencing that vulnerability assesment flowchart and making sure all the boxes are checked.
 
-How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
 
    running the OWASP dependency check is a good way to check for new vulnerabilities.
 
-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
 
    Ask the internet.
 
-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

    I learned a bit about software security in this course, however I do not feel I was completely successful in implementing anything. I will most likely not work in software security in the future.
